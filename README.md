Some simple programs made while learning the basics of Rust.

1. bubble_sort - quick implementation of algorithm to get familiar with basic syntax.
2. cli-tool - generic CLI tool to get familiar with passing arguments to a program.
3. compute-ndvi - a basic geospatial CLI tool for computing NDVI from a raster, dealing with using external packages and some more complex data operations.
